----Setup Encrpyted USB storage device

These scripts let you creat an encrypted usb storage device as well as mount and umount it from the correct location.
Once you run the make-enc script and create the storage device, the system will refuse to allow access if the storage device is not mounted

For the time being, creating the encrypted usb disk, as well as mounting the disk have to be done via command line.
I am considering adding a control interface to allow people to do these functions via the web but have not made up my mind on this..
